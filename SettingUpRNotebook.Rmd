This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load packages 
library(knitr)
library(readxl)
library(scales)
library(anonymizer)
library(lubridate)
library(forcats)
library(sorensonimpact)
library(googlesheets)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

cars <- read_csv("~/Desktop/cars.csv")

names(mtcars)

cyltable <- cars %>% 
  count(cyl) %>% 
  print()

cars %>% 
  count(cyl, gear) %>% 
  print()

cars %>% 
  summarise(meanmpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  print()

cars %>% 
  summarise(medianmpg = median(mpg, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  print()

cars %>% 
  count(cyl) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=cyl, y=n)) + 
  geom_col(fill="#741D5A")+
  labs(y="Number", x="Cylinders") +
  ggtitle("Number of Cars by Cylinder") +
  theme_minimal()

cars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=wt)) +
  geom_histogram()

cars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(meanmpg = mean(mpg))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
